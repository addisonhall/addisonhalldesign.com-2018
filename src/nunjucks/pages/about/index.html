            <h2>It all started in 2005.</h2>
            <p>I&rsquo;m a designer, web developer, and a bit of a WordPress nerd working out of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Addison+Hall+Design,+LLC/@32.364408,-90.016858,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x4c056df4f8e10bb4!8m2!3d32.364408!4d-90.016858" target="_blank">my little office in Brandon, Mississippi</a>. Since 2005, I&rsquo;ve worked with a lot of great people, both as clients and collaborators. So whether you&rsquo;re an organization in need of a complete website or you&rsquo;re a designer who needs help with code, I&rsquo;m happy to help however I can.</p>
